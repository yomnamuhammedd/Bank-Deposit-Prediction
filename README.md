# Bank-Deposit-Prediction
Embarking on a classification project, we aim to predict customer subscriptions to term deposits in a strategic marketing campaign led by a Portuguese bank institution. Our primary objective is to evaluate campaign success using machine learning for precise forecasting. By analyzing customer interactions, we aim to develop a model that anticipates term deposit choices, aligning with the bank's strategy to enhance decision-making and inform future successful marketing endeavors.
